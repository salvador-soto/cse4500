# CSE 4500 Class Portfolio

This is the place where I will save commits to all the core assigments and project for CSE 4500 - Platform Computing

## Core Assigment 1: Git 

I have made the github repo that will act as a space to store all my assignments and projects for CSE 4500

## Core Assignment 2: JSON

For this Assignment I decided to use Node.js to make a live server to parse JSON objects and show them in the console.

## Core Assignment 3: API

I have not started this assignment yet but I am thinking about making a small website that displays the weather based on location, possibly utilizing an open weather api for forecast.

## Term Project: Undecided

I am still brain storming on this, I will hopefully have a concept and begin work for it by the second progress report.
