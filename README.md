# Assignment 2 - JSON

## What did I do?

For this assignment I utilized HTML and a simple Node.js live server to display some self defined Javascript objects in the console. What I did was made the Object, used JSON.stringify to turn them into something the website can potentially display and then I used JSON.parse to parse the data into the console so that it is viewable that way.
