# Assignment 2 - JSON

## What did I do?

For this assignment I utilized HTML and a little javascript to display some self defined Javascript objects in the console. What I did was made the Object, used JSON.stringify to turn them into something the website can potentially display and then I used JSON.parse to parse the data so that different aspects of the object were accessible.
